## Both Pytorch and Keras Models
In this folder, two different versions of deep neural networks are implemented.
CreateGraph.py code is implemented in both pytorch and keras. 

## pytorch code files
One model (GNNModel.py) is implemented in pytorch. GraphDataset.py and trainModel.py are written in pytorch, too.
main_pytorch.py is the main file based on pytorch.

## Keras code files
Another model (GCNModel.py) is written in Keras.
main_keras.py is written in keras.
